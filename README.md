Dupfree is a Python-based tool designed to help users clean and organize their photo collections efficiently. It works by first scanning a folder of images to detect both exact duplicates (identical files) and near-duplicate images that may have minor differences, such as resizing, cropping, or slight edits. To achieve this, Dupfree uses techniques like image hashing or feature-based comparison to accurately identify duplicate pairs.

Once duplicates are detected and set aside, Dupfree goes a step further by analyzing the remaining non-duplicate images. It groups these unique photos into meaningful categories such as people, food, nature, buildings, and vehicles. This automatic categorization makes it easier for users to browse, manage, and enjoy their photo collections without the need for manual sorting.

Finally, Dupfree generates a clear report summarizing the duplicates found and the categories assigned to the non-duplicates. Users can review this report, preview the duplicate sets, and safely delete unnecessary files to free up valuable storage space.

In addition to local folders, Dupfree also offers integration with Google Drive. Users can connect their Google Drive account to scan images stored in the cloud, detect duplicates, and organize non-duplicates into categorized folders directly within their Drive. This makes it a powerful tool for managing both local and cloud-based photo libraries seamlessly.
